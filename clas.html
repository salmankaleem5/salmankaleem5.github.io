                    <h5>Background</h5>
                    <p class='flow-text'>The CLAS News Archive is a web page where users can find and read content from the University of Connecticut's CLAS department. The primary goal was to create a user-friendly page that made the browsing experience very easy. One of the requirements I received was to make this a single-page application, meaning users should be able to use the application to browse through content without reloading or opening a new page. The other requirement was to allow users to navigate back and forth through the "states" of the application, like in a regular website. To fulfill these requirements, I used AJAX and the HTML5 History API to provide a seamless experience for users.</p>

                    <h5>Implementation</h5>
                    <p class='flow-text'>The CLAS department already had a website with content setup on our development team's content management system. My task was to take all of that content and make it viewable in one page. To accomplish this, I developed server-side AJAX "actions" in PHP for each method of refining/sorting as described above. Now that I could retrieve content via AJAX, I developed JavaScript methods to render and update the "News Stories" list and the main posts section. Putting this all together, users could now browse content in the CLAS News Archive without once moving a new web page.</p>
                    <p class='flow-text'>The last step was to implement browser history navigation within our application. Based on client requirements, we tracked options to refine content and clicking on a story from the "New Stories" list as creating a "new" state, which users should be able to navigate between. Selecting a division, category, tag, or a news story causes a state to be pushed to the user's browser history. They can then use their browser's backward and forward controls like they would in a regular non-single page application.</p>


                    <p><i>Note: I developed this application and continued to support it until May of 2015. The current application may not reflect the work that I did. Everything that I wrote above describes my work on the application.</i></p>
